I constructed four different sequences to show that the way how pages are being accessed in system results in hit/miss
rate.
The first sequence is:
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
For such sequence the hit/miss rate will be 10.0 cause, we are accessing only one page ten times after first page fault
and each time increase its value for aging algorithm. Such sequence is the best case for aging algorithm.
Here are tests on different sizes of page frames:
    2-page frame:
        Hits: 10, Misses: 1, Hit/Miss ratio: 10.000000
    5-page frame:
        Hits: 10, Misses: 1, Hit/Miss ratio: 10.000000
    10-page frame:
        Hits: 10, Misses: 1, Hit/Miss ratio: 10.000000
The second sequence is:
3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1
For such sequence the hit/miss rate will depend on size of page frame. For small page frames there will be only misses.
 However, for size >= 3 the number of misses will be equal to three because on next accesses there will not be any page
 faults.
Here are tests on different sizes of page frames:
    2-page frame:
        Hits: 0, Misses: 12, Hit/Miss ratio: 0.000000
    5-page frame:
        Hits: 9, Misses: 3, Hit/Miss ratio: 3.000000
    10-page frame:
        Hits: 9, Misses: 3, Hit/Miss ratio: 3.000000
The third sequence is:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
This sequence is the worst case for any page replacement algorithm because we do not access any page twice. Therefore,
 all sizes of frames grantee us the 100% of misses and hit/miss rate equal to 0.0.
Here are tests on different sizes of page frames:
    2-page frame:
        Hits: 0, Misses: 20, Hit/Miss ratio: 0.000000
    5-page frame:
        Hits: 0, Misses: 20, Hit/Miss ratio: 0.000000
    10-page frame:
        Hits: 0, Misses: 20, Hit/Miss ratio: 0.000000
The forth sequence is specific for aging algorithm:
1 2 3 4 5 1 6 2 8 3 9 4 10 5
This sequence shows how aging algorithm removes not frequently pages from frame. Clearly can be seen for 5-page frame,
that we are trying to access the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th pages for second time but catching page fault. We are getting
only one hit when we are trying to access 1st page for second time.
Here are tests on different sizes of page frames:
    2-page frame:
        Hits: 0, Misses: 14, Hit/Miss ratio: 0.000000
    5-page frame:
        Hits: 1, Misses: 13, Hit/Miss ratio: 0.076923
    10-page frame:
        Hits: 5, Misses: 9, Hit/Miss ratio: 0.555556
