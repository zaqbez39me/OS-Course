The physical address refers to an actual part of memory in RAM.
It points to the page in physical RAM and provides the offset from the start of this page.
Operating system provides the virtual memory for an abstraction. Virtual memory is an illusion of having an unbounded
main memory. Therefore, the programs can be larger than physical memory. Virtual memory also has addresses and page
sizes. Virtual memory is linked with physical one and in address has special flag of presence in physical memory.
Virtual address contains the number of page in physical memory with which it is linked, if it is linked with any.
Therefore, the main difference is that the virtual address is an address in an abstract memory while physical address is
an address in actual physical memory.
