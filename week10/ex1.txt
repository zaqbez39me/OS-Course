I tested my program with 10, 50 and 100-page frames and found that the hit/miss rate depends on number of page frames.
The larger number of page frames causes the smaller number of misses. Therefore, the hit/miss rate increases with number of
page frames on random set of pages being accessed.
Here are results of tests:
    10-page frame:
        Hits: 10, Misses: 990, Hit/Miss ratio: 0.010101
    50-page frame:
        Hits: 51, Misses: 949, Hit/Miss ratio: 0.053741
    100-page frame:
        Hits: 375, Misses: 625, Hit/Miss ratio: 0.600000
